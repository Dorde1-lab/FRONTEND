<p>Apollinaire is considered one of the foremost poets of the early 
    20th century, as well as one of the most impassioned defenders 
    of Cubism and a forefather of Surrealism. He is credited with 
    coining the term "Cubism"[1] in 1911 to describe the emerging art
    movement, the term Orphism in 1912, and the term "Surrealism" in
    1917 to describe the works of Erik Satie. He wrote poems without
    punctuation attempting to be resolutely modern in both form and
    subject. Apollinaire wrote one of the earliest Surrealist
    literary works, the play The Breasts of Tiresias (1917), 
    which became the basis for Francis Poulenc's 1947 opera  
    Les mamelles de Tirésias.</p>
